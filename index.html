	<h1 class="loading">A sexy mistake.</h1>
	<p>But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. A sexy mistake. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.</p>
	<p>Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. <strong> You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</strong> <em> Fatal.</em> Say it in Russian!</p>
	<h2>You don't know how to do any of those.</h2>
	<p>It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</p>
	<ol class="loading">
		<li>I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!</li>
		<li>Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</li>
		<li>Guess again.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Can we have Bender Burgers again?</h3>
	<p>I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! We're also Santa Claus! I had more, but you go ahead. You're going to do his laundry? Belligerent and numerous. You can see how I lived before I met you.</p>
	<ul class="loading">
		<li>You mean while I'm sleeping in it?</li>
		<li>Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</li>
		<li>Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>No, I'm Santa Claus! Is that a cooking show? No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Who are those horrible orange men?</p>
	<p>You don't know how to do any of those. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. And then the battle's not so bad?</p>
	<p>I just told you! You've killed me! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</p>
	<p>Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.</p>
	<p>No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. I don't want to be rescued. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!</p>
	<p>Bender?! You stole the atom. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Oh yeah, good luck with that. Why did you bring us here? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.</p>
	<p>Who are you, my warranty?! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? You can see how I lived before I met you. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</p>
	<p>And until then, I can never die? You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Hey, guess what you're accessories to. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.</p>
	<p>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Ow, my spirit! A true inspiration for the children.</p>
	<p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' itâ€¦ then perhaps gifts! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.</p>
	<p>When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?</p>
